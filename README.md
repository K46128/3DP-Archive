# The Prototype Project
This project was started back in early 2023 as a way to build an affordable, and fast 3D printer that undergoes updates and changes once in a while.

## Inspiration
I originally based the project around the Ender 3, but I realized the abilities of the electronics of the printer were really, *really* underpowered for the speed of printing I was aiming for. There were many problems.

# Problems with Planning
After realizing the scale of the project, I realized the problems that I was going to encounter. At the time, I did not have much engineering experience, and even less programming experience.

## Mechanical Issues
Since I was not that good of an engineer back in 2023, I did not have a good base for making a full 3D model of the printer. I was originally planning to just make a 3D model of the full printer, but halfway through doing this I just decided to design it kind of like a driven dimension in Fusion 360. It took up to *10 tries* to correctly design a model for the ... *motor mount???*

[!IMPORTANT]
I am currently working on exporting all of the files from the Fusion 360 3D model.
